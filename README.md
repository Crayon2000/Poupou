# Poupou
This homebrew for Nintendo Wii was designed in 2010 to initiate my son to the Wii Remote and DDR dance pad (GameCube controller).
You simply touch anything and Thomas the train will change position and size.
A choo-choo sound will also be emitted.
The Thomas the train theme song will loop in the background until it drives you crazy.
To exit the game simply press the HOME button.
